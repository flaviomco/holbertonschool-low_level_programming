# 0x03. C - Debugging
In this project I did not have to actually  code, but rather to solve some proposed code errors to meet the requirements, the ideal was to debug the code until I finding what needs to be solved.
## Task Index
|File name              |Description                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
|[0-main.c](https://github.com/flaviomco/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/0-main.c)|Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.<br>You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only **one** line in this task.|
|[1-main.c](https://github.com/flaviomco/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)|Copy this main file. Comment out (dont delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.<br>- Dont add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.|
|[2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/flaviomco/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c)|Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.<br>- Line count will not be checked for this task.|
|[3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/flaviomco/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)|Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for _all_ dates and _all_ leap years.<br>- Line count will not be checked for this task.<br>- You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of `month` will never be less than `1` or greater than `12`) and valid days (i.e. the value of `day` will never be less than `1` or greater than `31`).<br>- You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).|
